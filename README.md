#C++11

My sandbox to dabble with C++11's new features.

So far I've tried:

1. [auto](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8542873/c11-auto-semantics)
2. [decltype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decltype)
3. [nullptr](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13816385/what-are-the-advantages-of-using-nullptr)
4. Ranged for loops, like foreach()...

I'll eventually end up writing about this at [BitByteYum](http://bitByteYum.com) after I get a better handle on it.
